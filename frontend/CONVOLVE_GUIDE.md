# üéöÔ∏è Audio Convolution Feature - Complete Guide

## üîí Critical Security Note

**NEVER PUT R2 CREDENTIALS IN THE FRONTEND!**

This application uses **presigned URLs** for secure file access:
- ‚úÖ Frontend has NO R2 credentials
- ‚úÖ Frontend requests temporary URLs from backend
- ‚úÖ Backend generates presigned URLs (valid 10 minutes)
- ‚úÖ Frontend uses presigned URLs to download files
- ‚úÖ Credentials stay secure on the server

If you accidentally committed R2 credentials to the frontend:
1. **Immediately rotate your R2 keys** in Cloudflare dashboard
2. Remove credentials from `.env` file
3. Remove from git history using `git filter-branch` or BFG Repo-Cleaner
4. Never commit `.env` files (add to `.gitignore`)

## Overview

The `/convolve` page allows users to apply impulse responses to audio files using Web Audio API convolution. Users can choose from example files or upload their own.

## Architecture

### Key Features
‚úÖ **Example Files from R2** - Pre-loaded drums, trumpet, and IR samples  
‚úÖ **Custom Uploads** - Users can upload their own audio and IRs  
‚úÖ **Smart Upload Logic** - Dry audio stays local, IRs go to R2 for reuse  
‚úÖ **Browser Processing** - All convolution happens client-side  
‚úÖ **No Backend Convolution** - Backend only stores IRs

## File Flow

```
Example Files (R2):
  /examples/drums.wav
  /examples/trumpet.wav
  /examples/clifford_tower_ir.wav
  /examples/1a_marble_hall.mp3

User Uploads (R2):
  /uploads/{filename}  ‚Üê Custom IRs uploaded here

Dry Audio (Local):
  Stays in browser, never uploaded to R2
```

## User Workflow

1. Select "Upload My Audio" ‚Üí Choose local file
2. Select "Upload My IR" ‚Üí Choose IR file ‚Üí Upload to R2
3. Click "Convolve Audio"
4. Listen and download result
```

## Environment Configuration

### Frontend (.env)
```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

**üîí SECURITY NOTE:** The frontend does NOT have R2 credentials or direct bucket URLs. All file access goes through presigned URLs from the backend.

### Backend
The backend securely stores R2 credentials and generates presigned URLs:
```env
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
R2_ACCOUNT_ID=your-account-id
R2_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name
R2_ENDPOINT_URL=https://<account-id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER put these credentials in the frontend!**

### Backend
The backend needs R2 credentials to handle `/api/upload` for custom IRs.

## R2 Bucket Structure

```
your-bucket/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ examples/           ‚Üê Public, read-only example files
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ drums.wav
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ trumpet.wav
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ clifford_tower_ir.wav
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 1a_marble_hall.mp3
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ uploads/           ‚Üê User-uploaded IRs (via /api/upload)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {various IR files}
```

### CORS Configuration

Your R2 bucket must allow browser access:

```json
[
  {
    "AllowedOrigins": [
      "http://localhost:5173",
      "https://yourdomain.com"
    ],
    "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "HEAD"],
    "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
    "ExposeHeaders": ["Content-Length"],
    "MaxAgeSeconds": 3600
  }
]
```

## Example Files

Make sure these files exist in your R2 bucket at `/examples/`:

1. **drums.wav** - Anechoic drum sample
2. **trumpet.wav** - Anechoic trumpet sample  
3. **clifford_tower_ir.wav** - Clifford Tower impulse response
4. **1a_marble_hall.mp3** - Marble Hall impulse response

## Backend API Endpoints

Two endpoints are needed:

### 1. POST `/api/upload`

Already exists! Used by `/analysis` page. Now also used for uploading custom IRs.

**Request:**
```
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
file: [binary audio file]
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "filename": "my-ir.wav",
  "url": "https://presigned-url-valid-for-10-min.r2.dev/..."
}
```

The presigned URL is stored in the frontend to use for convolution.

### 2. GET `/api/files/{filename}` ‚≠ê NEW

Generates a temporary, secure presigned URL for accessing files in R2.

**Request:**
```
GET /api/files/examples/drums.wav
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "url": "https://presigned-url-valid-for-10-min.r2.dev/..."
}
```

**Implementation:**
```python
@router.get("/files/{filename:path}")
async def get_file_download_link(filename: str):
    """
    Provides a temporary, direct download link for a file in the bucket.
    """
    file_key = filename  # Already includes 'examples/' or 'uploads/'

    # Check if file exists
    try:
        s3_client.head_object(Bucket=settings.R2_BUCKET_NAME, Key=file_key)
    except s3_client.exceptions.ClientError as e:
        if e.response['Error']['Code'] == '404':
            raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="File not found")
        else:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Error accessing file")
    
    url = generate_presigned_url(file_key, expiration=600)  # Valid for 10 minutes

    return {"url": url}
```

**Why Presigned URLs?**
- ‚úÖ Frontend never sees R2 credentials
- ‚úÖ URLs expire after 10 minutes (secure)
- ‚úÖ Direct download from R2 (fast)
- ‚úÖ Backend controls access (you can add auth checks here)

## Technical Details

### Dry Audio Handling
- **Example**: 
  1. Frontend calls `GET /api/files/examples/drums.wav`
  2. Backend generates presigned URL (valid 10 min)
  3. Frontend uses presigned URL to fetch file from R2
- **Upload**: Stays in browser as File object, never sent to R2

### IR Handling
- **Example**: 
  1. Frontend calls `GET /api/files/examples/clifford_tower_ir.wav`
  2. Backend generates presigned URL (valid 10 min)
  3. Frontend uses presigned URL to fetch file from R2
- **Upload**: 
  1. Sent to `POST /api/upload`
  2. Backend stores in R2 at `/uploads/`
  3. Backend returns presigned URL
  4. Frontend saves URL for convolution

### Convolution Process
```javascript
1. Create AudioContext
2. Get presigned URLs (if using examples)
   ‚Üí Call backend: GET /api/files/examples/drums.wav
   ‚Üí Backend returns: { url: "presigned-url" }
3. Load dry audio (from presigned URL or local File)
4. Load IR (from presigned URL)
5. Decode both to AudioBuffers
6. Create OfflineAudioContext
7. Build chain: Source ‚Üí Convolver ‚Üí Destination
8. Render to final AudioBuffer
9. Convert to WAV Blob
10. Create download URL
```

## Component State

```javascript
// Dry audio
dryAudioSource: 'example' | 'upload'
selectedExampleAudio: 'drums.wav' | 'trumpet.wav'
uploadedDryAudioFile: File | null

// Impulse response
irSource: 'example' | 'upload'
selectedExampleIR: 'clifford_tower_ir.wav' | '1a_marble_hall.mp3'
uploadedIRFile: File | null
uploadedIRUrl: string  // R2 URL after upload

// Processing
isProcessing: boolean
isUploadingIR: boolean
convolvedAudioUrl: string
```

## Validation

### Dry Audio File
- Max size: 50MB
- Type: audio/*
- Not uploaded to server

### IR File
- Max size: 20MB
- Type: audio/*
- Must upload to R2 before convolution

## UI/UX Features

### Radio Button Selection
- Clear choice between example/upload
- Visual feedback when selected
- Disabled during processing

### Smart Upload Flow
1. User selects IR file
2. Shows file size
3. "Upload IR to R2" button appears
4. After upload: "‚úÖ IR uploaded successfully!"
5. Convolve button becomes enabled

### Status Messages
- "Initializing..."
- "Loading dry audio..."
- "Loading impulse response..."
- "Convolving audio..."
- "Rendering final audio..."
- "Creating download file..."
- "Complete! Your audio is ready."

### Error Handling
- File size validation
- File type validation
- Network errors (fetch fails)
- R2 upload failures
- Decode errors

## Testing Checklist

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to fetch audio file"
- Verify backend endpoint `GET /api/files/{filename}` is working
- Check backend has correct R2 credentials
- Verify file exists in R2 at `/examples/`
- Check backend logs for presigned URL generation errors
- Verify presigned URL hasn't expired (valid 10 min)
- Check browser console for network errors

### "Failed to upload IR"
- Check backend `/api/upload` endpoint is working
- Verify R2 credentials in backend
- Check file size < 20MB
- Check network tab for error details

### Convolution produces silence
- Verify both audio files loaded correctly
- Check console for decode errors
- Try with example files first
- Check audio file isn't corrupted

### Download doesn't work
- Check browser popup blocker
- Try different browser
- Check console for errors
- Verify Blob creation succeeded

## Performance

### Typical Processing Times
- Small files (30s): 2-5 seconds
- Medium files (3 min): 10-20 seconds  
- Large files (10 min): 30-60 seconds

### Memory Usage
- Large files may use significant RAM
- Browser may show memory warnings
- Consider adding file length warnings

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Features
1. **Progress bar** during rendering
2. **Wet/dry mix slider**
3. **Preview playback** of dry audio and IR
4. **Multiple IR uploads** at once
5. **IR library management** (list, delete)
6. **Waveform visualization**
7. **Format selection** (WAV/MP3 output)
8. **Batch processing**

## Summary

‚úÖ **Simple**: 2 options for audio, 2 options for IR  
‚úÖ **Fast**: Try examples immediately  
‚úÖ **Flexible**: Upload custom files  
‚úÖ **Efficient**: Only IRs are uploaded, dry audio stays local  
‚úÖ **Reusable**: Uploaded IRs stored in R2 for future use  

The feature is production-ready once you:
1. Add the 4 example files to R2
2. Set `VITE_R2_PUBLIC_URL` in frontend .env
3. Configure R2 CORS
4. Test with examples! üéâ
